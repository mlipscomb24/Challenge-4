Challenge 4 - Create Blog Webpage

# Challenge-4
Challenge 4 - We needed to create a webpage that would allow the user to input criteria into a form that will be rendered to another webpage to show as a blog post. Both pages required the function to toggle between light and dark mode. The landing page where the blog post is posted (rendered) required that there be a button to navigate easily back to the input form to continue adding posts as needed (i.e. Back Button to form). 


## About This Project

In this project we had to create arrays for employees, for loop to allow the user to continue to add employees, and a way to store the data to allow for averages to be populated.

Note - minor error utilizing the deployed page that is provided with GitHub, however if deployed from LiveServer the issue did not exist and the button to 'Add Post' works each time.
